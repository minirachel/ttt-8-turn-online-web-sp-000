#1 build a method composed of many other previously defined methods (helpers)
#2 Use method return values to control logic??
#3 use an input validation loop/recursion to create a loop

def turn
end
  #ask user for their move by position 1-9
  #receive user input
  #convert position to an index
  #is move valid?
    #yes- make move and display board
    #no- ask for different move

def display_board

end

def valid_move?

def position_taken?
